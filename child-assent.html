    <p style="text-align: center;">Child verbal assent to participate in research study</p>
    <p><strong>Primary Investigator:</strong> Kathryn Schuler, kschuler@sas.upenn.edu</p>
    <p><strong>Why you are being asked to participate?</strong> Your parent gave me permission to ask you if you would like to be in this study. I am trying to
      learn more about how kids learn languages, so I’m asking kids to play this computer game
      where they learn a pretend language.</p>
    <p><strong>What will happen during the study?</strong> During the game, you will learn a pretend language and press some buttons to answer
      questions about the pretend language. I might also ask you to try to say some words in the
      pretend language.</p>
    <p><strong>Do I have to be in the study?</strong> If you don’t want to do this experiment you don’t have to. If you start playing the game, you
      can change your mind and stop playing any time you want.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have any questions?</strong></p> 
    <p><strong>Do you want to be in the study?</strong></p>
